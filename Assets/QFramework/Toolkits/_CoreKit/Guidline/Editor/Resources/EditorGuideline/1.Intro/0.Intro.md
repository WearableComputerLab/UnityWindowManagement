## 0.Intro

Hi, I am liangxie the author of QFramework, which has been 7 years since the first code submission.

A lot of functions have been added and a lot of improvements have been made in the use experience.

This tutorial will be included in the official QFramework documentation and published in the QFramework editor window

## QFramework Intro

QFramework is a rapid development framework suitable for any type of games and application projects.

It provides an architecture and a large toolset.

The architecture is a SOLID architecture, based on MVC, which supports CQRS, IOC, layered patterns, and DDD for project design, which will be described later.

The toolset contains a large number of class libraries, such as singletons, state machines, events, object pools and other tools, as well as common solutions for resource management, UI management, audio management and so on.

QFramework is an progressive framework.It means you can develop as you learn, without having to master all the tools and apis.

You can see this in the left-hand sidebar in general.

OK, without further ado, let's take a look one by one.
