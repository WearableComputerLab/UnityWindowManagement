## 1.Quick Start

The quickest way to get started with QFramework is to write a script that calls the API provided by QFramework.

We create a script anywhere, as follows

``` C#
using UnityEngine;
using QFramework;

public class QuickStartExample : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        Log.I("Hello QF");
        
        "I' am liangxie.".LogInfo();
    }
}
```

Hang to any GameObject and run Unity with the following result:

``` c#
Hello QF
I' am liangxie.
```

So now we have the QFramework.

The most recommended way to get started with QFramework is to learn the toolset and class libraries provided by QFramework, because it is relatively easy.

Then you'll learn about the development architecture provided by the QFramework.

OK, let's move on to the next one.
