**The project is based on two mature github and rewrite some functionsï¼š**
1. https://github.com/hecomi/uWindowCapture
2.  https://github.com/cfloutier/Unity-VNC-Client

**The following is a guide on how to open the code after downloading it:**

After downloading the compressed package, if you are using Unity Hub, you should enter the folder named "AudioVisualization" when selecting the path, and open "UnisaWindowCapture" (this is also the final path import target)
If you directly use "AudioVisualization" as the path, it may cause path errors.

To open this tool, we need to find the **Main** scene in the scene folder and open it.
